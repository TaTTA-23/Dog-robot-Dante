ROS2 workspace skeleton for Dog-robot-Dante

This folder contains a minimal ament_python package `dante_bringup` with a simple
example node and a launch file. It's a scaffold to start developing ROS2 nodes.

Notes:
- Building this requires a ROS2 installation and colcon. Use this as a starting
  point inside a ROS2-enabled environment.
